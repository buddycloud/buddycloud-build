# This is an example of a release configuration file.

# first declare any global names (which you want to be available to other
# functions), like this:
global testFunc TEST

# then write the definitions of the variables and functions.
TEST=testvalue

testfunc() {
    var='inside' # a local variable which doesn't need to be declared
    echo $var the function.
    TEST=newvalue
}
